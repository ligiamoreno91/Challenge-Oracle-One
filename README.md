A text encoder and decoder built using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

To be more difficult I made a two way data binding system for textarea fields and for showing and hiding elements, works with accented characters (will be replaced by equivalent), lower and upper case letters.

## How does it work?

To encode a text we will take all vowels and replace by a term according to the table below.

| a | e | i | o | u |
|--|--|----|----|--
| enter | imes | ai | ober | fat

To decode we do the inverse.
